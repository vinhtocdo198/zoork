## Introduction

Zork: The Haunted Manor is a text-based game created for my Professional Software Development assignment, based on the
original Zork game and inspired by hidden object games that I have enjoyed playing since I was small. Many thanks to my
teacher, Dr. Richard Skarbez, for his guidance and support.

## How to Play

- Common commands include `look`, `take`, `use`, `interact`, and `go`.
- Examples: Type `go north` to move north, or `use key` to use the key in your inventory.
